Hi! I'm Minjoo Seo :)
I’m a third-year student at Korea University 🐯, majoring in French Language & Literature and Information Security.
I’m part of GBGB (our French club!) and the KU Literature Club.

I speak Korean, English, and French 🇰🇷 🇺🇸 🇫🇷
I love reading, watching films, coding just for fun, and café-hopping around Seoul ☕📚💻

Right now, I’m interning at Michelin Korea. 

### A bit about my journey
I graduated from Daeil Foreign Language High School, where I first started learning French.
For the KSAT, I studied Geometry, Life Science, and Earth Science (yep, very sciencey 😂).
Still, I came back to French in college—guess I just really love the language!

I enjoy diving into new topics and being surrounded by curious, creative people. Let’s connect!
