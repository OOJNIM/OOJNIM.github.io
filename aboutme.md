Greetings from Joomin Publishing! I'm Minjoo, the founder.  
환영해요! 저는 민주예요.

 I'm currently a third-year undergraduate student at Korea University, and I truly love writing.    
 현재 🐯고려대학교🐯 3학년 재학생이고, 글을 정말 좋아합니다.

 Joomin Publishing offers two types of content: ‘Interview’ and ‘Reading in Seoul’.  
 Joomin Publishing은 ‘Interview’와 ‘Reading in Seoul’이라는 두 가지 콘텐츠를 제공합니다.

 🌎 In ‘Interview’, we share stories of people who are building unique worlds of their own.  
 🌎 ‘Interview’에서는 자신만의 세계를 만들어가는 사람들의 이야기를 들려드릴게요.

 🏙️ ‘Reading in Seoul’ introduces cozy reading spots and recommends inspiring books to enjoy in the city.  
 🏙️ ‘Reading in Seoul’에서는 서울에서 읽기 좋은 장소와 읽어볼 만한 책을 추천드릴게요.

Thank you so much for visiting Joomin Publishing!
