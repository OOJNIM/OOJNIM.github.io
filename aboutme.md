Greetings from Joomin Publishing! I'm Minjoo, the founder. I'm currently a third-year undergraduate student at Korea University, and I truly love writing. Joomin Publishing offers two types of content: ‘Interview’ and ‘Reading in Seoul’. In ‘Interview’, we share stories of people who are building unique worlds of their own. ‘Reading in Seoul’ introduces cozy reading spots and recommends inspiring books to enjoy in the city. Thank you so much for visiting Joomin Publishing!
